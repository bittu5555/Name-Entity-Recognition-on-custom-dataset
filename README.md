This repository contains a custom Named Entity Recognition (NER) model trained on a specific dataset. NER is a powerful natural language processing (NLP) technique that identifies and categorizes named entities. A Named Entity Recognition (NER) system identifies and categorizes specific entities in text data. This ner is trained on movie description data. It recognizes entities like names of people, organizations, locations, dates, and more. For custom text data, NER analyzes unique content, extracting relevant entities based on predefined categories or tags. It helps in understanding the context of the text. Customized NER models can be trained with domain-specific data, enhancing accuracy and relevance to particular applications such as medical records, legal documents, or social media analysis.
